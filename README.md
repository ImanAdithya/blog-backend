## Project Overview

This project is a backend API built with **NestJS** that provides:

- **User Authentication** using JWT with login, logout, and registration.
- **Blog CRUD** operations to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **Unit Testing** with Jest to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Features

### Authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- npm or yarn
- A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and its connection configured (if used)

### Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the App

```bash
npm run start:dev
